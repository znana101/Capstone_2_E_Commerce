# Capstone_2_E_Commerce
In this project, we tackle the challenge of automating product categorization for e-commerce platforms. Text documents, especially product descriptions, contain valuable information that can influence market trends and investment flows. However, manually categorizing products into specific types is time-consuming and resource-intensive.

This project developed a a predictive classification model for e-commerce using a deep learning approach with a Bi-LSTM architecture in Natural Language ProcessingÂ (NLP) to automatically classify product descriptions into four distinct categories; 'Electronics', 'Household', 'Books' and 'Clothing & Accessories'

## Discussion
1) The NLP model uses tokenization, padding & truncating and embedding to process the text data. 
2) The model uses LSTM and obtains an accuracy of 96.3% which is more than 85%.
3) The F1 score of this model is 0.96 which is above 0.7.  
4) The model was saved in .h5 format while the tokenizer is saved using .json.

Conclusion: The model is able to predict and categorize the unseen products into 4 categories.
